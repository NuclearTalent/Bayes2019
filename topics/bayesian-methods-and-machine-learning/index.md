You will need `tensorflow` and `keras` for running this lecture notebook and the accompanying exercise. In this directory, please run

    conda deactivate
	conda env create

which reads the environment.yml file and creates the virtual environment `talent-env-ml`. It can be activated:

    conda activate talent-env-ml
