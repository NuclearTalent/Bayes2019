This is useful because high-dimensional data (with $p$ features) may have nearly all their variation in a small number of dimensions $k<p$, i.e. in the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix that have the $k$ largest eigenvalues. If we project the original data into this subspace, we can have a dimension reduction (from $p$ to $k$) with hopefully little loss of information.\n",
