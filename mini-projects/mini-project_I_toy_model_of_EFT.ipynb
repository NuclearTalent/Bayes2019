    "The overall project goal is to reproduce various results in a paper co-authored by Daniel and Dick (and others): [*Bayesian parameter estimation for effective field theories*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03618).  It's a long paper, so don't try to read all of it!  (At least not now.)  We'll guide you to the relevant parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper uses toy models for effective field theories, namely Taylor series of some specified functions, to present guidelines for parameter estimation. This will also be a check of whether you can follow (or give you practice on) Bayesian statistics discussions in the physics literature.\n",

    "You'll find summaries in section II that touch on topics we have discussed and will discuss.  The function\n",

You'll work on the mini-project the first Thursday and Friday afternoons in the exercise session and we'll do a recap early next week.  There is nothing to hand in but we'll be happy to review what you come up with."
