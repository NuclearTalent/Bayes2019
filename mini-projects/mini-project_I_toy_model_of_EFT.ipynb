    "The overall project goal is to reproduce various results in a paper co-authored by Daniel and Dick (and others): [*Bayesian parameter estimation for effective field theories*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03618).  It's a long paper, so don't try to read all of it!  (At least not now.)  We'll guide you to the relevant parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper uses toy models for effective field theories, namely Taylor series of some specified functions, to present guidelines for parameter estimation. This will also be a check of whether you can follow (or give you practice on) Bayesian statistics discussions in the physics literature.\n",

There is nothing to hand in but we'll be happy to review what you come up with."

    "* The 5% error is a *relative* error, meaning it is 0.05 times the data at that point.  This means if you generate a Gaussian random number `err` distributed with standard deviation 0.05, the value of sigma for the log likelihood is `sigma[i] = data[i] * err` (use the data, not the theory at `i`).\n",
    "* The `show_titles=True` option to corner will show central results and one-$\\sigma$ error limits on the projected posterior plots.\n",
    "* The `quantiles=[0.16, 0.5, 0.84]`option to corner adds the dashed vertical lines to the marginal posteriors on the diagonal. You can obviously change the quantiles if you want another credibility region.\n",
    "* The python command `np.percentile(samples, [16, 50, 84],axis=0)` might be useful to extract numerical values for the credibility region and the mean from a python array `samples`of shape (nsamples,ndimensions).\n",
    "* The example on [Fitting a Model to Data](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/v2.2.1/user/line/) from the emcee documentation may be useful to supplement the examples in the TALENT notebooks."
